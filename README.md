# Next.js Clerk Authentication - User AuthenticationðŸ”‘

## Project Description

This is an example of a [Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org/) app that uses [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) for authentication and user management.

With this project I intended to get more experience with app authentication and the creation of a login/sign-up architecture.

## What I improved on, by working on this project

- Using Next.js app router
- Protected routes
- Authentication
- Building a frontend UI
- UI design with TailwindCSS 

### Routes
- /
- /sign-in
- /sign-up
- /dashboard

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
